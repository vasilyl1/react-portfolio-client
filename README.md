# Professional Portfolio built using React client and Express server
React application using Express server.

The purpose of this application is to showcase the portfolio of projects, with the ability to collect and store messages at the back-end using the latest software development industry technologies.

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase the skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time positions. 

An effective portfolio highlights strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Candidates who have portfolios with deployed web applications (live on the web applications) have an advantage in their career search. 

In many cases several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an invitation for the interview from the potential employer.
